## Architectural Pipeline

### Data Preprocessing & Setup
>*Blue/Teal Components*

The Multi-seed initialization implements seeds (42, 2023, 7, 123, 314) to ensure statistical validity across multiple experimental runs. BiLSTM features are loaded from enhanced feature extraction pipeline providing rich contextual representations. Speaker mapping establishes dialogue participant relationships while balanced class weight computation focuses on minority class enhancement for improved performance on underrepresented emotions.

### Advanced Graph Construction
>*Green/Magenta Components*

#### Graph Creation System
Dialogue-based graph creation implements sophisticated edge relationships through chronological connections with 3-step context window for temporal understanding, speaker-based long-range dependencies for conversational flow modeling, emotion-based clustering with similarity thresholds for semantic grouping, and cross-speaker reaction modeling for interaction dynamics.

#### Minority Enhancement
Enhanced minority oversampling implements 6x amplification with feature perturbation for robustness, ensuring balanced representation of underrepresented emotion classes while maintaining feature diversity through controlled noise injection.

### Enhanced GNN Architecture
>*Green/Magenta/Purple Components*

#### Input Processing Layer
Input processing performs feature projection with speaker embeddings (32D) for comprehensive participant representation and contextual understanding.

#### Graph Attention Network
Three-layer GAT implements residual connections and attention mechanisms for hierarchical feature learning and long-range dependency modeling.

#### Classification System
Dual classification provides auxiliary (intermediate) and main (final) outputs for multi-level supervision and improved gradient flow.

#### Attention Enhancement
Emotion attention pooling performs contextual feature enhancement through selective focus on emotion-relevant graph regions.

#### Regularization Framework
Regularization implements high dropout (0.7), edge dropout (0.2), and weight decay for comprehensive overfitting prevention and improved generalization.

### Enhanced Loss & Optimization
