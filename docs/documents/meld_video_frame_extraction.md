## Architectural Pipeline

### Input Layer
>*Blue Components*

The MELD JSON Data serves as structured dataset splits containing train/dev/test partitions with video paths and labels. Video Files (.mp4) provide raw multimodal conversation videos requiring frame extraction. Previous Checkpoint (Optional) enables resume capability from interrupted processing sessions. DLib Models supply pre-trained CNN face detection and 68-point facial landmark models.

### Configuration Layer
>*Teal Components*

The Config Class implements centralized parameter management including num_frames set to 32 for standard frame count per video, crop_size configured to 224×224 for ResNet-compatible dimensions, face_confidence threshold at 0.6 for detection accuracy, and tracking_params for correlation tracker settings and failure recovery mechanisms.

### Core Processing Engine
>*Diamond/Control Components*

The Process Dataset Orchestrator functions as the main workflow coordinator managing split-wise processing operations. The Atomic Checkpoint Manager ensures data integrity with emergency backup capabilities. The Graceful Terminator provides time-based and signal-based session management with automatic save functionality.

### Speaker Identification Subsystem
>*Magenta Components*

#### Main Speaker Detection
The Identify Main Speaker component performs primary speaker detection across entire video sequences through advanced algorithms.

#### Speaker Tracking System
The Speaker Tracker implements advanced tracking featuring face encoding comparison with similarity thresholds, dynamic focus tracking with confidence scoring, and centrality weighting for main speaker detection accuracy.

#### Mouth Analysis Engine
The Mouth Analyzer performs sophisticated speech activity detection through Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) calculation from facial landmarks, rhythm analysis with peak/valley detection, and speaking pattern consistency scoring for enhanced accuracy.

### Face Processing Subsystem
>*Green Processing Components*

#### Face Detection Module
DLib CNN Face Detection provides high-accuracy face detection with confidence scoring mechanisms for reliable identification.

#### Face Recognition System
Face Recognition Encoding/Matching generates 128-dimensional face embeddings with similarity comparison algorithms for consistent speaker tracking.

#### Correlation Tracking Engine
The Correlation Tracker implements robust face tracking featuring quality assessment with configurable thresholds, automatic failure recovery and re-initialization, and multi-frame tracking consistency validation.

#### Landmark Detection System
Facial Landmark Detection extracts 68-point facial landmarks for comprehensive mouth analysis and expression capture.

### Frame Processing Pipeline
>*Green Sequential Components*

The Frame Extraction from Video utilizes OpenCV-based video decoding and frame sampling techniques. Bounding Box Expansion (0.7x) provides context-aware region expansion around detected faces. Crop & Resize to 224×224 implements standard preprocessing for deep learning model compatibility. Frame Validation & Quality Check ensures frame quality and completeness verification.

### Storage & Output Layer
>*Purple/Orange Components*

#### Frame Storage System
The Atomic Frame Saver implements fault-tolerant file writing with temporary file mechanisms for data integrity.

#### Preprocessed Frame Output
Preprocessed Frames generate organized storage producing 32 frames per video in UMF (Useful Masked Frame) and MF (Masked Frame) formats with hierarchical directory structure by dataset split.

#### Metadata Management
Metadata JSON provides comprehensive metadata including frame directory paths and mask information, original labels and video identifiers for complete traceability.

#### Progress Tracking
Checkpoint Data maintains persistent progress tracking with processed video lists for session continuity.

### Safety & Recovery Systems
>*Red Control Components*

The Emergency Backup System implements multi-level backup strategy with tar.gz compression for data protection. Session End Handler provides signal-based graceful shutdown with state preservation. Retry Mechanism offers configurable retry logic with maximum 3 attempts for failure recovery.
